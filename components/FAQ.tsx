    question: "Do I need prior coding experience?",
    answer:
      "Not at all. This program is built for absolute beginners. We'll start from the very basics and guide you step by step until you can confidently build and launch your first website.",

    question: "What if I miss a live session?",
    answer:
      "No problem. Every session is recorded, and you'll get full access to the replays. You can also ask questions afterward and still get the support you need.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much time will I need each week?",
    answer:
      "We recommend 2 to 3 live sessions per week (about 2 hours each). Add a little practice in between, and you'll see real progress within just 30 days.",

    question: "What will I have by the end of the program?",

      "By the end, you'll have a complete personal website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, fully deployed online for friends, employers, or clients to see.",

    question: "Do I need a laptop for this program?",

      "Yes, a laptop makes learning and building projects much easier. If you don't have one yet, you can start practicing with a smartphone using free coding apps or an online editor, then switch to a laptop when possible.",
